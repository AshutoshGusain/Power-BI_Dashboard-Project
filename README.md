# Power-BI_Dashboard-Project
This is a Power BI end-to-end Project

 **Connecting & Shaping Data**

I focused on building automated workflows to extract, transform, and load our project data using Power Query, and explore common data connectors, storage modes, profiling tools, table transformations, and more:

Data connectors

Storage & import modes

Query editing tools

Table transformations

Connecting to a database

Extracting data from the web

QA & Profiling tools

Text, numerical, date & time tools

Rolling calendars

Index & conditional columns

Grouping & aggregating

Pivoting & unpivoting

Merging & appending queries

Data source parameters

Importing Excel models



**Creating a Relational Data Model**

I reviewed data modeling best practices, introduce topics like cardinality, normalization, filter flow and star schemas, and begin to build our AdventureWorks data model from the ground up:


Database normalization

Fact & dimension tables

Primary & foreign keys

Active & inactive relationships

Relationship cardinality

Filter context & flow

Model layouts

Data formats & categories

Hierarchies



**Adding Calculated Fields with DAX**

I introduced data analysis expressions (DAX). Created calculated columns and measures, explore topics like row and filter context, and practiced applying powerful tools like filter functions, iterators, and time intelligence patterns:



Calculated columns & measures

Math & stats functions

Conditional & logical functions

The SWITCH function

Text functions

Date & time functions

The RELATED function

CALCULATE, FILTER & ALL

Iterator (X) functions

Time intelligence patterns



** Visualizing Data with Reports**

This is about bringing my data to LIFE with reports and dashboards. I reviewed data viz best practices, built and formatted basic charts, and added interactivity with bookmarks, slicer panels, parameters, tooltips, report navigation, and more:



Data viz best practices

Dashboard design framework

Cards & KPIs

Line charts, trend lines & forecasts

On-object formatting

Table & matrix visuals

Conditional formatting

Top N filtering

Map visuals

Report slicers & interactions

Bookmarks & page navigation

Numeric & fields parameters

Custom tooltips

Importing custom visuals

Managing & viewing roles (RLS)

Mobile layouts

Publishing to Power BI Service


**I also used powerful artificial Intelligence tools like decomposition trees, key influencers, smart narratives and natural language Q&A, along with performance optimization techniques to keep the reports running smoothly at scale.**
